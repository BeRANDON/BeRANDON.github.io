How to Build a Personal Knowledge Repo

We can classify the requirements of PKR in detail items

# Deffernitial Processing Among Different Types of Information

# Easy Management and Extension
> Easily adding associated knowledge source (no matter the *web source* , *cites* , *text* , *specific contents* or other resouce). They can just adding into a folder or a virtual bucket which will manager them in a well-designed relationship presentation. 
> This can be realize in a way similar to the twitter/weibo. For an example, using the weibo to publish a message and then the message can automatically collect all the resource to the 'tag-based folder/bucket' and then you can view all the resources in a presenatation of all resources. This function is just a little novel and improvement from the previous resource tagging. Essentially, it combines the "Content Management System" (CMS) , "web source marking & digging". 

# Knowlege Skeleton Presentation

# Version Control
>Normally, the version control is not very important, because most people cares about the most correct and latest conclusion for time-saving purpose. Unless you need to save the old version when you are not very sure the new changing is correct or just worry about the changing is too obvious even on the opposite view-point. You can just trace back to the old version or make a alternative view of both of them.
>Also the Version Control may necessary for relying control. This part will be discussed in another place.

# Digital Object Identifier & Relationship Relying Control
>The website resources are more important than local resource along with the mobile office and cloud computing trend. However, the management of "Digital Object Identifier" (DOI) is difficult to handle with.
>For example, the text descripment contains many object which may terms in different styles or presentations, but linking to the same thing or similar object (a cluster). In such ocassion, the efforts to highlight them out manually after the they are writen are hopeless. Therefore, we need to output them into a virtual terminal or central control box for further coinsistence control or linking. Some one argues that these linking may be useless and too noisy for that ones who already know about such information. This thought is so trivial, because user can select the search engineer instead. However, when the articals are created by authors, they want to highlight some relying relationship of some important points. Just like the 'paper style', we need to cite some previous researches  during writing. The relying relationship can construct a graph-toplogy which may need "Graph Theory" to support the analysis. 
>Another usage ocassion is that, user have a configuration palcement or announcement. When the new version is published, the old one may be not work any more, therefore, a time stamp tree control and a relying tree control seem necessary for PKR. It is more GEEK to realize automatic configuration with latest resources based on these control infromation. Furthermore, version control can assist such requirement.
>***No matter what, make the DOI control dependent from the artical or just generilzed the artical into a abstract version can make the presentation efficient and make the knowledge efficient.***

# Other Advanced Thoughts
>To make a huge improvement, we can introduce the "Social Network Service" (SNS) to ultilize the "cognitive surplus" by easy collectiong & remark & post & tracking, introduce "Text Mining" to simpliy classify the unsorted and untagged knowledge, introduce "data mining" & "machine learning" to 1) remediate your incorrect cognitive,  2) finding the similar partner which can bring you helps & heuristics, 3) manager, re-cluster and cross-link all the knowledge which can bring you more.

All these requirements are difficult to realize. It cannot done by one person. Moreover, these thoughts can be remediated by others' recommends and realzied by a growing activated gourp.
