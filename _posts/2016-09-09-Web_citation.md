# Writing skills

Suppose you get mountains of information from Internet, sometimes the information distributed seperatedly in different website. Each individual has his own different opinion and even opposite to others. You need a good tool-set to record the information, and then re-create your own knowledge representation with your own words, but with the reference to such previous message.

Therefore, citation for website link or content is non-trivial. However, citation in journal papers is very common, but not supported so well in website-blog writing, since people think such representation is not official, the website content is dynamic changing. 

Consequently, I need a citation tool-set, or tool-chain to facilitiate my writing. I have thounsand of tabs in my chrome bookmark and I can not turn out them to my own knowledge, it is a waste of time and energy, because once I donot re-write something, or manager them in a hierarcy structure, or label them with fine-grained tags, I will forget the knowledge points quickly.

## Citation

Traditional paper management software is developed for a long time, such as zotero, mendeley, Endnote. Endnote has the longest history, but lacks of flexibility. I prefer zotero since it is open-sourced and you can develop and customize some plugins for zotero. 

> However, the citation of website content is not so robust. There are several reasons:
1. Website content may change or disable in the futhure.
2. Content is not stored locally, then you can hardly review the content.

Suppose you need to write a conclusion in markdown format about an issue, you need to add some exteranl original source links as references, so that reader can extend their reading. How to manage the external links is our core concerned problem.

> Here, I will list some possible solutions, that I will explain in detail in futhure once I am avaliable. Solutions including: 
1. Traditional Paper Management Software: Mendeley, Zotero, citeulike, 
2. Content Clips: Evernote, OneNote, Pocket, InstanPaper,
3. Website browser based plugins: Candy, RefME, Yawas, 
4. Bookmark Extension: (Specifically for chrome) Lynn,

`The essential purpose of citing website is for better writing experience. Therefore, some writing tools will also be discussed and listed here.`
1. Writing platforms, like `Evernote`, `SimpleNote` have many third-party plugins or softwares to support them, and they are also avaialble in mobile devices.
2. Editor tool, like `sublime text` has so many package that can link to different account, like package `latexing` can link to zotero, mendely, citeulike, et.al accounts to get the bibtex database for latex writing.
3. Online writing tool, like `overleaf` `shareletex`. I am using 'overleaf' right now, since it can import bibtex from zotero, mendely, citeulike, also it can support git clone & push without password permission.
