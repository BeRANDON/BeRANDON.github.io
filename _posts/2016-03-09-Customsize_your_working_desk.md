# WangZiRu

Ref to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxazzDvbqPY to see the Zealer's head founder WangZiru's desktop area.
Basically, his requirement for office working is as same as many officers, who are highly concerned about their desktop. I will conclude his desktop as follows:

- Computer: Macbook pro + dock (belkin) + LG 35inch display + pegasus r4 (RAID 10 storage)
- TwelveSouth Stand for macbook pro
- focal (music box) which support ipod together with desktop computer
- WASD customized machanical keyboard
- ERGOTRON (LG 35 inch display stand)
