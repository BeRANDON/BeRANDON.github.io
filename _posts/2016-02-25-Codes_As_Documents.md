title: "WYCIWYD - What your code is what your document"
---

> WYSIWYG - 'what you see is what you get' is a famous design principle. When refer to codes, it is essential for author to add enough comments to make the codes more easy to be understood. That means one would be better to make the codes look like the description documents. Here, I will not suggest to generate easy-understanding codes by introduing the principle of constraining the name of variable. Instead, I discuss about how to merge markdown documents with other interpretation script language like python.

## IPython

Ipython is a great tool, that can generate website that can run python scripts, while author can insert enough comments between the code blocks.

## Python in Markdown

Combing the comments syntax in Markdown and pythong will merge the two language together. Or you can rewrite the markdown interpretation.

for example;
```python
'''
print("hello world.");

'''
```
